# Getting GWAS Data in tranSMART
This repo is dedicated to inform data loaders/programmers on how to load GWAS data into tranSMART. 

All scripts and templates available in this repository assumes the use of tranSMART-batch as loading tool.

## Generating GWAS metadata
Before loading GWAS data, it is necessary to generate some meaningful metadata to support the GWAS data. This metadata will be visible in 

the tranSMART interface alongside with the data. In order to ease the process of providing meaningful metadata, a GWAS metadata template 

has been created (can be found here: https://github.com/Lundbeck-Biometrics/tranSMART-

GWAS/tree/master/GWAS_METADATA_TEMPLATE). The column "Field Value" is the only column that needs to be updated with data on the 

study.
